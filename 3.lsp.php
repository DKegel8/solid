The Liskov Substitution Principle states that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behaviour.

 Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing described the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows[1]:

Subtype Requirement: Let {\displaystyle \phi (x)}\phi (x) be a property provable about objects {\displaystyle x}x of type T. Then {\displaystyle \phi (y)}{\displaystyle \phi (y)} should be true for objects {\displaystyle y}y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

One rule that should be abided by in PHP is that any method should return the same type as that of its parent. For example, if the search method of T returns an instance of Illuminate\\Support\\Collection then any search method of S should also return an Illuminate\\Support\\Collection.

The four conditions for abiding by the Liskov Substitution principle are as follows:
1 Method signatures must match:
    * Methods must take the same parameters.
2 The preconditions for any method canâ€™t be greater than that of its parent:
    * Any inherited method should not have more conditionals that change the return of that method, such as throwing an Exception.
3 Post conditions must be at least equal to that of its parent:
    * Inherited methods should return the same type as that of its parent
4 Exception types must match:
    * If a method is designed to return a FileNotFoundException in the event of an error, the same condition in the inherited method must return a FileNotFoundException too
