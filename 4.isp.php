Interface Segregation Principle

Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific Clients should not be
forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.  This principle deals
with the disadvantages of implementing big interfaces.

Letâ€™s look at the below IShape interface:
*/

interface Ishape {
	function drawSquare();

	function drawRectangle();

	function drawCircle();
}

/*
This interface draws squares, circles, rectangles. class Circle, Square or
Rectangle implementing the IShape interface must define the methods
draw_square(), draw_rectangle(), draw_circle().
*/

class defaultCircle implements Ishape {
	function drawCircle() {
		// TODO: Implement drawCircle() method.
	}

	function drawRectangle() {
		// TODO: Implement drawRectangle() method.
	}

	function drawSquare() {
		// TODO: Implement drawSquare() method.
	}
}

/*
Itâ€™s quite funny looking at the code above. class Rectangle implements methods
(draw_circle and draw_square) it has no use of, likewise Square implementing
draw_circle, and draw_rectangle, and class Circle (draw_square, draw_rectangle).

If we add another method to the IShape interface, like draw_triangle(),
*/

interface IshapeFault {
	function drawSquare();

	function drawRectangle();

	function drawCircle();

	function drawTriangle();
}


/*
The classes must implement the new method or error will be thrown.

We see that it is impossible to implement a shape that can draw a circle but not
a rectangle or a square or a triangle.  We can just implement the methods to
throw an error that shows the operation cannot be performed.

ISP frowns against the design of this IShape interface. clients (here Rectangle,
Circle, and Square) should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not
need or use.  Also, ISP states that interfaces should perform only one job (just
like the SRP principle) any extra grouping of behavior should be abstracted away
to another interface.

Here, our IShape interface performs actions that should be handled independently
by other interfaces.

To make our IShape interface conform to the ISP principle, we segregate the
actions to different interfaces.  Classes (Circle, Rectangle, Square, Triangle,
etc) can just inherit from the IShape interface and implement their own draw
behavior.

We can then use the I -interfaces to create Shape specifics like Semi Circle,
Right-Angled Triangle, Equilateral Triangle, Blunt-Edged Rectangle, etc.
